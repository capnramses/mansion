#The Mansion of Dr Anton#

This is the source code for the WebGL 3d game I have on my website:
[antongerdelan.net/dungeo](http://antongerdelan.net/dungeo/)

I made it on a sick day when feeling delirious, and added bits and pieces over
the next few eves. It was going to be a dungeon explorer but it just turned
into a mash-up of games I had in the '90s; Wolfenstein 3-D, Dangerous Dave in
the Haunted Mansion, Nightmare 3-D, Ken's Labyrinth.
